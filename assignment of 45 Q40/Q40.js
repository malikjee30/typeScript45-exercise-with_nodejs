// these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.
//  Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
//   Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
//   If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
//   Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
